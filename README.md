# Application Tracker
Unit 3 Project, Full REACT CRUD Application of a Job Application tracker
## Description

This is a centralizied area for the group to store applications an individual has applied to and information about that application & process. When a user accesses the site, when looking at a specific application should be able to see Company Name, title, link, location, interview phase, pay, and personal personal insights. Users should be able to add in a new application they have submitted with details. Other users should be able to see it on the Home Board and view those same details. 

Ideally we should be able to track who has already applied and have an archive function for when a job is no longer available. 

All about the journey not the destination! UWU
